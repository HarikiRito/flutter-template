# Flutter Template Project

This project is a Flutter template that uses Streams as the main way to manage state, extending the usage with RxDart. It is designed with a feature-based project structure that isolates the logic into features for easy management. The project also includes a code linter with Dart analyzer and an i10n setup.  

## Features
- **State Management**: The project uses Streams as the main way to manage state, extending the usage with RxDart. This allows for reactive programming, making it easier to manage and update state in your Flutter applications.  
- **Dependency Injection**: The project uses Riverpod as a dependency injector. This makes it easier to manage dependencies and provides a clear and direct way of accessing them.  
- **Feature-based Project Structure**: The project is structured based on features. This means that each feature of the application is isolated into its own directory, making it easier to manage and understand the codebase.  
- **Code Linter**: The project includes a code linter with Dart analyzer. This helps to maintain a consistent coding style and catches potential issues early in the development process. 
- **i10n Setup**: The project includes an i10n setup, allowing for easy localization of the application.
